The script then attempts to extract credentials (hashes and potentially cleartext passwords, depending on the system configuration and user privileges) from the LSASS process. The output is saved to a file for review.  This is a simulated attack because the Mimikatz module is downloaded, not directly executed, making it safer for a testing environment. We also use a file output to prevent credential leakage in the command output.",
